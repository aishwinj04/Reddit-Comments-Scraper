Also, I have sat next to stinky people too many times to count. Bad breath AND BO. If you crack open an orange, it will deodorize or block their scent. Even the people nearby will thank you.

Mail: any mail lives on the counter for 24 hours. It will be sorted, addressed, trashed/recycled, coupons clipped and shredded with in one day. 

The wtf spot: each floor has a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I need to do with this‚Äù aka wtf spot it‚Äôs a drawer, nice decorative doom box of sorts. If I don‚Äôt have a place yet, don‚Äôt know  I put it there. It has a place, it‚Äôs unseen and if I need it it‚Äôs in one of two - three places. 

The side door method: if I‚Äôm in my car and I‚Äôve got stuff that‚Äôs trash and it doesn‚Äôt fit in my car door. I take it with me to throw out. At the end of each week I dig out all the dry papers and everything from the side of my car door and toss it.

The vacuum method: every morning I vacuum the level in my home that is used the most. It is a quick vacuum to get up the chunks. Then I quickly vacuum one other level in the house. This goes for dusting one main area of the house a day.

The towel method: I have a stack of towels that is used to dry off dogs, cleanup, spills, wipe off dusty areas, cleaning up other messes, and is a great filler for daily laundry

The dishwasher method: since I live in a household where the adults fingers are broken, I generally handle the dishes. Generally, if it‚Äôs dishwasher safe I‚Äôm going to put it in the dishwasher and run the dishwasher. It uses less water, get stuff done and I can quickly take care of a major chore, if someone in the house doesn‚Äôt like it, then they can do the dishes. Since they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt get to complain about how stuff gets done

I am a procrastinator by nature, have executive dysfunction, and a self managed industry, and am the project manager of my entire household

These things made me and keeping some sort of order in my life. This is in addition to everything else I do every day. See 90/10 rule for the days I do not have my stuff together.",23

Lekkusu,"I was a mover, and the one lesson way above all else that I learned was this:

Buy uniform boxes of 2-3 different sizes (don‚Äôt just save a bunch of Amazon boxes), maybe small, medium, and XL, and put EVERYTHING into boxes.

Here is how you label those boxes 1. The room it is supposed to go in at your new apartment or house 2. Fragile, heavy, or important (for things you want to open right away). That‚Äôs it. Not what the items are, that doesn‚Äôt matter at all when they‚Äôre being moved.

Every stray lamp or swifter sweeper or picture frame or whatever non-furniture item that you own that isn‚Äôt put into a box will slow down your move, and will take up far more space in the truck because you‚Äôll have to create strange special spots for them. 

Only make necessary exceptions like bikes, large workout equipment, lawn equipment, etc., but I assure you this strategy can shave hours off of your move. 

A bonus tip, is start with every single one of those boxes and stack them all the way to the ceiling as the first thing loaded in your truck. Then, put mattresses and box springs against them to hold the wall in place, and then sofas to press supportive weight against your mattress box wall. Happy moving!",20

lilacasylum,"When talking to customer service, being kind despite your frustrations can get much better and quicker results than cursing and yelling. I've had several people who work in customer service roles tell me that they will go above and beyond for someone who's kind but will drag their feet and do the bare minimum for a rude person.",22
