Impossible-Motor9940,Same here looking for an easy liberal that has no exams,7
livingdeppressedp,rta 180 with tom third,6
ko_star,pol128 was easy for me‚Ä¶.discussion posts and 2 (or 3 I can‚Äôt rmr) tests online. I did it over the spring semester so it was just watching 1 or 2 movies every week and writing a discussion post for each film.,3
ConfidentDistance253,Pop culture!! Super easy course from what other eng students have said,3
HonestEmu9467,"Intro to astronomy (With Peter Luca), politics and film, problems in philosophy, perspectives of psychology.

Most intro courses are fairly easy, the courses I recommended are ones I‚Äôve done except the psych course and they were all low effort, really engaging, and were really easy to get 4.33 in :)",3
kak4sh1,CPCS181 should be an easy A+ for you and the upper liberal for that course is also easy.,2
ThoseFunnyNames,"Honestly, take some art liberals, they give your mind a break, I found from the math of econ going to art class was a welcomed break.  And it was actually a lot of fun, it was the fun creative side of marketing.  Would take again",2

Fit-Philosopher6387,"GEO 210 with Prof Raymond Garrison, easy A+ ! However, you should attend his lectures because he tells you exactly what's going to be on the exam.",1
, Any geo or philosophy course is really easy,1
,I personally think the two US History courses are easy,1
chlorox_user_101,Aryee is the worst prof at TMU. 110 awful reviews on rate my prof. I would rather beat my meat with sandpaper than have to take a class with that guy again.,12
AmitNemeziz,Which prof do you recommend for that course?,2
amateur-man9065,"aryee is bad if u actually want to learn but for easy grade? he's fine cuz his midterm and final is based off the slide. just take it thru chang so its online, easy A",1

OutrageousRain8659,"Hi, im taking cpcs181 with peter luca online this summer semester. were the quizzes and midterms online? I'm working full-time and would prefer a class that is fully online. 

also, do you have any tips on how to do really well in the course?",1
Asomns47,Eng majors can't take CPCS181. [https://www.torontomu.ca/calendar/2023-2024/courses/physics/PCS/181/](https://www.torontomu.ca/calendar/2023-2024/courses/physics/PCS/181/),2
imortaldragon06,do you have any specific course recommendation?,1
LegitimateMacaron455,"Honestly, the exam and midterm are online and are based on the slides. However, there are 3 major assignments. But they are set up in a way to help you with your final essay.",1
GtBrnd,"A bit project heavy, I‚Äôd probably stay away from that one",1
AmitNemeziz,I‚Äôm looking for something I don‚Äôt have to invest too much time in cuz I‚Äôll have 7 courses that term,2
AmitNemeziz,I‚Äôll check them out thank youüôè,1
shrubberyn,The worst mark on my transcript is from one of his classes that I couldn‚Äôt switch out of lol,6
shrubberyn,Literally any of them but Aryee or Manshouri. Richard Garrison is the one you want the most. Jeanne Maurer is good too apparently.,4

ThoseFunnyNames,"There was one, it was in regards to media, I'll try and find my transcript.  But it was essentially how we should look at art.  It wasn't too hard I found it interesting and the prof was really into it as well.",2

,"You can look at the geo content for 30 mins before each test and youll be fine bc its super easy. But I rly recommend looking at fully online chang courses for your lower lib bc they just have online exams and weekly discussion posts which are brainless. Art history and anything art related are offered on chang and are fully online, or as specified, and as a STEM student its almost impossible to get less than an A in the courses. You can private msg me if you have any questions! Ive taken a lottttt of lower libs",5
____angel____777,Hey! I think geography would be a great easy option! I personally took it and ended the course with a 98. Youll be chilling!,2
masterpilot374,"Garrison is amazing, such a reasonable prof",3
Leather_Parsley_2575,Definitely not K Wayne Forsythe either. He was the most condescending and rude prof i‚Äôve ever had and all the tests are based off random niche things he says in class so you HAVE to be there or you‚Äôll fail üò≠,2
OutrageousRain8659,super easy. definitely take it if you get him,1
GtBrnd,"Stephen Sheps. Nice guy, but the course is still pretty heavy",1
EntertainmentOk8005,hey! is it okay if a private message you about lower liberal help?,1
PayOld3761,Do chang courses get the same amount of credits as regular ones?,1
Friendly_Resource742,Which geography did you choose??,1
